TikTokVideoRipper

This version does not upload the video and seems to sometimes run into issues where it dupes 1000 frames.
It also has so features commented out as this whole thing is a work in progress.

This grabs the top 20 videos from the trend tab of TikTok based on the name that you include, and then edits the video to be in 16/9 with a blurred background and concats them together.
ffmpeg is required for this.
